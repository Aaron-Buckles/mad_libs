# Mad Libs
A mad libs game made in python where the user can write their own stories!

## How to play
1. When you run the game, the first thing you will see is the story selection menu. To select a story just type in its name and press enter.
1. Now you will be prompted to fill in all the blanks of the story. If the game prompts you to type in a noun, type in a noun of your choice and press enter. Do for all blanks until the finished story is shown.

## How to create you own stories
1. Create a .txt file with the name of your story. (**no spaces in filename**)
1. Make sure the file is in the same directory as the python script.
1. You type your story into the text file. (**you must manually add newlines to the story**)
