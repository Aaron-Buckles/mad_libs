# Mad Libs
A Mad Libs game made in python where the user can write their own stories!

## How to play
1. When you run the game, the first thing you will see is the story selection menu. To select a story just type in its name and press enter.
1. Now you will be prompted to fill in all the blanks of the story. **Example:** If the game prompts you to type in a noun, type in a noun of your choice and press enter. Do this for all blanks until the finished story is displayed.

## How to create your own stories
1. Create a .txt file with the name of your story. (**no spaces in filename**)
1. Make sure the text file is in the *stories* folder.
1. Type your story into the text file. (**you must manually add newlines to the story**)
1. For blank words that the player must fill in, use a tag. **Example:** `The <n> ran to the <a> park!`
